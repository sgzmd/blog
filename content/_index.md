## Hi there! 👋

My name is Roman. In my professional life, I'm a [software engineer at Meta](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sgzmd/) - something of a big 
career choice for me after 14 years at Google, where most recently I've been leading [Android Security and Privacy](https://www.android.com/safety/)
organization in London. My sphere of
interests is in an interesting overlap between security and user experience -
after all, the most secure phone is the one turned off, with no SIM card, in a
block of concrete at the bottom of a river - but it doesn't mean it's easy (or
at all possible!) to use.

In my personal life I'm a proud dad, an obsessive reader (sci-fi all the way!),
amateur photographer, more-than-average guitar player and a [software/hardware tinkerer](https://github.com/sgzmd). 

In this blog I will be talking about both work and personal projects, as well as
anything I feel like mentioning.
