## Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

My name is Roman. In my professional life, I'm an [engineering manager at
Google](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sgzmd/),
working on [Android Security](https://www.android.com/safety/). My sphere of
interests is in an interesting overlap between security and user experience -
after all, the most secure phone is the one turned off, with no SIM card, in a
block of concrete at the bottom of a river - but it doesn't mean it's easy (or
at all possible!) to use.

In my personal life I'm a proud dad, an obsessive reader (sci-fi all the way!)
and a [software/hardware tinkerer](https://github.com/sgzmd). 

In this blog I will be talking about both work and personal projects, as well as
anything I feel like mentioning.

If you would like to reach out, please send an email to roman[at]kirillov.cc
