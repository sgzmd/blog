I would like to thank Calvin for his amazing [Maverick](https://maverick.canhtran.me) theme, which I shamelessly
hacked up to my liking. It was _exactly_ what I wanted - just enough of a mix of
geekiness and beautiful typography.

Further to that, I wanted to express my gratitude to the wonderful folks who
built [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) - perhaps the only modern blogging platform that
allows you to keep your sanity, and focus on writing your posts, not trying to
strangle the CMS-cum-ERP behemoth.
