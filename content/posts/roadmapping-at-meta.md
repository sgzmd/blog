I don't think it will come as a surprise for any of you, but every company, big or small, has to do planning. They often say, that any plan [of battle] falls apart at first contact with the enemy - but after being through _countless_ planning sessions, I came to, perhaps, counterintuitive realisation that the outcome of the planning process doesn't matter as much, as the process itself.

That, of course, doesn't mean that the outcome doesn't matter - you have to go where you are going, or else you'd end up somewhere else. But the process of roadmapping often acts as a way of aligning expectations of company leadership, and challenging energy of engineers in the right direction. Let me explain you, what I mean.

The process of planning at Meta starts with the top leadership - often Mark, or some of his top leutenants - posting an update on Workplace (think of it as Facebook for Facebook) - sharing an update, on what in their opinion are key directions and challenges for the company for next half (unlike many other companies, Meta plans in halves, not quarters).
