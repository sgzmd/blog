Over and over again, on X/Threads/Reddit I see debates about why software engineers have to sit through "useless meetings" and Zoom calls instead of focusing purely on writing code.  

It's a fair question, and not as simple as it looks. As a Software Engineer at Meta I am very protective of my calendar, and I ruthlessly cut meetings where my presence is not essential. But you cannot avoid them entirely - and the further you grow in your career, the more meetings you will likely face.  

Growth does not automatically mean "more chatter". The reality is that once you reach a certain level, impact is measured not only by your personal code output, but by how effectively you can direct the efforts of a whole team or even multiple teams. To do this you need to understand their goals, priorities, and constraints - and that requires communication. Andy Grove's classic [High Output Management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_Output_Management), written decades ago but still perfectly relevant, draws a distinction between high-leverage and low-leverage activities. For senior and Staff+ engineers, writing code is often a low-leverage activity compared to influencing direction across a broader group.  

There are rare exceptions - the so-called "legendary engineers" who are valued almost entirely for their technical depth. For example, I worked closely with a former maintainer of Rust in the Linux kernel - his expertise was so unique that it opened doors everywhere. But even then, without the ability to align and find common ground, you will not get far: people need to trust your judgment and want to work with you.  

So meetings and discussions are not chatter for the sake of chatter. They are tools: ways to build trust, align expectations, and remove friction. Technical excellence remains essential, but career growth also depends on your ability to influence others through communication.  

For my mentees (and previously for my reports when I was managing) I often recommend Camille Fournier's [The Manager's Path](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/the-managers-path/9781491973882). It highlights this shift very clearly: as you progress, success relies less on isolated brilliance at the keyboard and more on how well you collaborate and align with others.
