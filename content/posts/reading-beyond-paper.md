I must have mentioned that I am an avid reader, and with the number of books I'm
reading, keeping physical books is simply not an option (besides, all of our
many, _many_ bookshelves are already occupied by kids' books, so there you go).
Naturally, many years ago (even before e-ink was a thing I guess) I switched to
reading on mobile devices.

My first e-reader was - don't laugh - Siemens ME45. I still remember the process
of transforming `.txt` files into Java sort-of applets (J2ME - rings a bell?),
and then reading on a tiny screen.

That's how this device looked, the screen was comparatively tiny (by the modern
standards), and so were letters - but I guess my vision was a lot sharper back
then?

Time has gone by, I went through a multitude of pocket-sized devices (anyone
remembers Palm Pilot and their quirky `.prc` files?), and at some point I came
across my first Android phone - necessarily, it was an amazing Google Nexus One.

This was a big leap for my reading - unlike certain iP****, you could just
upload files to the device and then use your favourite book reader app. It was
marvelous. 

Roughly along the same time I came across the best book reader of all times -
namely, the [Moon+ Reader](https://www.moondownload.com/). This is the best
thing that happened to reading since invention of the book, and I'll explain you
why. Don't get me wrong, on the first sight the UX looks kinda clunky,
unintuitive and more than a bit ugly at places, but once you jump through all of
the hoops of setting it right just-for-you - what a marvel it is!

Around the same time I believe first e-ink devices have emerged. They were
expensive, and they were not really good - and I had a fair few of them. At some
point Amazon's Kindle has very clearly manifested itself as the king of e-book
reading in the West - don't get me wrong, Kindle is not a bad devices. It's just
.. not very good. 

In many ways, it follows the same-old mantra of Apple -
there's one way of doing things, there's one way of buying things, and if
you want something beyond that, then you are clearly wrong, you shouldn't want
it. So I was looking for alternatives. Some honorary mentiones definitely
include Ukrainian-made Pocketbook - they made some rather underpowered, but very
nice-to-use devices, which, while not being very hackable, were fairly
customisable to begin with, which made them a pleasure to use.

But at some point someone really smart (presumably, at Barnes&Noble?) thought:
we have an open operating system, which can be infinitely customised to your
liking. And we have a technology for reading. Why don't we marry these two? And
while Nook is basically long gone, the triumphant procession of Android-based
e-readers continues, with no stop in sight. And this gets us to Onyx Boox.

Not much is known about Onyx Boox as a company, except a few facts:

* They are from China
* They've been making Android e-readers since whopping 2006
* And finally, in the last few years, they got bloody good at it.

They make some absolutely mind-blowing e-note devices (read: e-book with a
large, 8"+ high resolution e-ink screen, with a high quality - usually Wacom -
digitizer built in, which can be used with a EMR stylus). They are running
modern-ish Android versions (think Android 11), and they can have Play Store
enabled (while they are not Google certified, as it is unlikely an e-ink device
can pass CDD and GMS requirements, basically everything works well).

And that was the final game changer. Imagine an e-book reader which you can set
up the way you, with all the bells and whistles, which weights only 150 gramms,
and works without charger for a week? That's Onyx Boox for you - or, more
specifically, Onyx Boox Poke series with your favorite ebook reader.

In this blog post I wanted to explain how to set up Onyx Boox just the way you
want it, with minimal fuss, and getting exactly what you need from it, and no
more - but I gueess I got carried away, so I'll leave it for the next post. Stay tuned!
